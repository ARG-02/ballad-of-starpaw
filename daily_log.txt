Daily Log For AI Project

Day 1:
    Both -
        Brainstormed ideas for AI Project
            Decided on a video game that uses hand gestures as controls
        Game will mostly likely be a 2D platformer
        Development will be done through PyGame
        Main character for game will be a dog with the whole game having a "dog" theme
        3/4 of the way through the tutorial
        Tutorial: https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/#sprite-groups
        Art: https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=dog

Day 2:
    Neil -
        Finished the tutorial game - Figured out pygame pretty good dog is good very nice

Day 3:
    Both -
        Kingdom name - Fetchlands
        Game name - The Ballad of Starpaw (Fantasy)
        Dog name - Starpaw, Villian name - Nightsoul

        Story -

            These 2 brothers are 2 princes of kingdom
            One day, someone tells one of the brothers he is bad dog
            Then he turns into nightsoul. This is why you tell dog, he good!
            He runs away and makes his own spooky kingdom.
            He gets all the dogs from around the bad dog world.
            He is king of the Bad Dogs (TM)

            The only way to stop NightSoul is for Starpaw (other brother)
            to journey across the 3 - 5 levels,
            to tell him he very good dog, yes he is what a little ragashit.
            Then he comes back, game end
