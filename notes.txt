Debugging-

 - it's falling too slowly when there's no collisions
 - CLIPPING CLIPPING CLIPPING!!!!
 - Jumping and turning around animation turns weird!!
 - Running animation is too fast
 - Left collisions always happen, right collisions never happen (Change that)
 - Falling detection animatino not woprkgin
 - White colorkey and brown colorkey (Size down the idle btw) - Do it everytime pygame load image - DO LATER!!
